                            developing great relationships (platonic, business, and romantic). Those same two single
                            people went on to pursue degrees in psychology with a focus in counseling; combining their
                            own experiences and education to help those going through social challenges.</p>

                            <hr />
                            <p>Hey! I was a successful photographer for 3 years before I found my interest in
                                psychology. I noticed my shortcomings in developing
                                meaningful and lasting relationships, but I had a passion for helping others,
                                this led me to pursue a Masters Degree in Counseling at Penn State and becoming a high
                                school Counselor.
                            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"></p>While working, I was able to further
                            understand the main reasons for conflicts between
                            students were because of some of the same things I lacked, interpersonal skills. I met
                            Autumn at Penn State, we were both in the same program. I always admired Autumn; always
                            enthusiastic about what you have to say and very attentive. We were both single at the
                            time and would joke around about how people should trust us with relationship advice
                            because we were smart enough to stay single. </p>

                            <p>What's up ya'll! Not sure how to start these, but I was always a people person. I like to
                                make people happy, it makes me happy, and I like to think that people enjoy my company
                                (Ellie edit: EVERYONE LOVES HER). While I love people, I never truly became vulnerable
                                enough to fully give my self to them. This was due to traumatic experiences with family
                                relationships and relationships in general that I've had as a child. I knew this had to
                                change and it would start with understanding, so I went to Penn State to pursue a
                                psychology degree.
                            <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"></p>After graduating I worked as a Juvenile
                            Counselor to help troubled youth get back on
                            track. At Penn State is where I met Ellie. We connected, I loved her honesty with
                            herself and others, and the unwavering standard she holds herself to. We would always
                            joke around about how we are single by choice to work on ourselves and people should
                            look to us for advice on relationships. </p>

                            single" was thrown
                            around jokingly to mutual friends and between each other. Poking fun at our
                            struggles with relationships and acting as if we are superior when we know that is
                            definitely not the case. Though, we realized that this allowed us to self reflect
                            and work together to figure out what the root of our challenges were and how to
                            solve them. Eventually we worked on this together on and off after college and now
                            what was once a joke between friends, is now our dream of helping others that share
                            our struggles, coming to reality.</p>
